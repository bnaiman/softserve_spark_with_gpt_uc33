Write a function that reads a text file in the format presented below, and then ensure that it returns a data frame of table content with proper columns.

| id|              Col1| Col2|

+---+------------------+-----+

|  1|     one,two,three|  one|

|  2|     four,one,five|  six|

|  3|seven,nine,one,two|eight|

|  4|    two,three,five| five|

|  5|      six,five,one|seven|

First, you'll need to read the file line by line and parse the content to extract the relevant data. Given that the file has a consistent format, you can employ the following approach:

Read the file line by line.
Skip the decorative lines (like '+---+...').
Extract the headers.
Extract the data rows.
Convert the extracted data to a data frame.
You can achieve this using the pandas library in Python. Here's a function that accomplishes this:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

def read_custom_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Strip whitespace and filter out decorative lines
    lines = [line.strip() for line in lines if not line.startswith('+')]

    # Extract header and data
    header = lines[0].split('|')[1:-1]
    header = [col.strip() for col in header]

    data = []
    for line in lines[1:]:
        row = line.split('|')[1:-1]
        row = [col.strip() for col in row]
        data.append(row)

    df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=header)
    return df

# Usage:
filename = "your_text_file.txt"
df = read_custom_file(filename)
print(df)
Just replace "your_text_file.txt" with the path to your actual text file and run the code. This will provide you with a DataFrame that contains the table content from the file.

please provide pyspark version of code

Certainly! The approach will remain quite similar, but we'll use the PySpark's DataFrame API to manage the data. Here's how you can do it using PySpark:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql import Row

def read_custom_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Strip whitespace and filter out decorative lines
    lines = [line.strip() for line in lines if not line.startswith('+')]

    # Extract header
    header = lines[0].split('|')[1:-1]
    header = [col.strip() for col in header]

    # Convert the data into a list of Row objects for PySpark
    rows = []
    for line in lines[1:]:
        values = line.split('|')[1:-1]
        values = [v.strip() for v in values]
        rows.append(Row(*values))

    # Create a SparkSession
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ReadCustomFile").getOrCreate()

    # Convert list of Row objects to DataFrame
    df = spark.createDataFrame(rows, schema=header)

    return df

# Usage:
filename = "your_text_file.txt"
df = read_custom_file(filename)
df.show()
Ensure you have Spark and PySpark installed and correctly configured to use this code.

Also, in a distributed setup, the file reading logic would typically need to change (for example, using Spark's distributed file reading capabilities), but since the example suggests a small file and the question is specific to the parsing, I've shown a single-node version for simplicity.
